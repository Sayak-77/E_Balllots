         Online voting is a unique concept on its own as voting is mainly conducted in physical mode ,
        but along with that we have tried to many unique features to our website which not only help to
        make the website different from others but also provide various facilities to the user which can
        help them and also provide a great experience while using the website.
        <br><br>
        The user can create their own accounts, select their own passwords, vote according to their
        beliefs , read news and so much more, while helps to make the project as dynamic as possible
        and the project can have many new features added to the website which will help to make the
        website dynamic and flexible , helping the users to make their experience on the website more
        customized.

        This site will help to make voting accessible to all, aged people who are not able to reach
        physical voting booths will be able to vote without any inconvenience, the project will help in
        ensuring that democracy is in right hands and the opinions of the people are voiced and not
        altered by intermediate people who wish to alter the voting process for their own benefits.

        The risks associated with the project were low as our project didn’t require any heavy technology
        however there was a risk of database failure which was successfully prevented by the group
        members by making the link as secure as possible leading to better traffic management and better
        performance of the website as a whole.

        It took 3.5 months to complete the project where around 5 days were required in order to gather
        the requirements, and another 5 to 6 days were required in order to analyze the requirements and
        develop a plan. Coding took the most amount of time as implementation of all the requirements
        was a tedious task, and the following span of 5 to 6 days will be given to each testing,
        deployment and maintainability respectively.

        <li>Physical voting is not accessible to all and has many openings for problems to occur which can
          compromise the whole voting process.</li>
        <li>Therefore E-Ballots ensures to provide the users with an
          easy voting experience and one which is free of any type of biases and is not prone to any human
          errors.</li>
        <li >It provides many sections such as the parties participating in the election and their
          agendas along with latest news.</li>
        <li>Results of the elections, which make the website much more
          interesting and easy to use.</li>
          <li>This is where the e-voting can be used to
            reduce the time, increase the number of votes so that a fair party or an individual is elected by the

        The procedure or the system by which a party or an individual with extraterrestrial leadership
        qualities, humility, urge to do the right thing and additional humanitarian qualities gets elected by
        the people, for the people and with the people is termed as Voting. Voting serves as an important
        aspect in the Indian Constitution which needs to be conducted in a fair way always. Often the
        offline voting systems require large amounts of time, expenditure and the processes are tampered
        in numerous ways in the remote villages or areas. Online Voting System embedded with
        Blockchain security can be used as a remedy for this which would optimize the voting process,
        enhance the utility, accuracy and versatility of the system.
